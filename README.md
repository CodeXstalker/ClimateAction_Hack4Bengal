## ðŸ”°the Problem we found

- Unconsious consumption
- Attitute of insensitivity toward environment

These two issue is increasing the insane amount of carbaon based gas or greeen house gas in the atmoshphere.Which in turn leads to rise in temperature.

## ðŸ”° Whats the Solution?

Our solution **CoFo : Embracing Carbon Neutrality with Joy** is a mobile app that promote:-

- **Consious consumption** :- Our application offers a functionality that allows individuals to list unused items, which can then be obtained by others either through voluntary means or in exchange for payment, as determined by the person listing the item.
   
- **Attitute of senstivity toward environment** :- We added this by implemting the feature of organizing the campaingn anf collaborating with people around you or acrooss the globe as it is like social media;

## ðŸ”° Immediate Future Improvements:

- Will include AIML to detect the amount of carbon in the items
- Will Improve UI/UX
- Will Build the hybrid application so that it can be accessible in all devices
- Will develop the WhatsApp and Telgram bot for the same
- Will develop web extensions
